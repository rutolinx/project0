    	<h2> Covid 19 - Corrona Virus</h2> 
      <p> Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has spread from China to many other countries around the world, including Kenya. Depending on the severity of <span class="covid">COVID-19’s</span> international impacts, outbreak conditions—including those rising to the level of a pandemic—can affect all aspects of daily life, including travel, trade, tourism, food supplies, and financial markets.
      	To reduce the impact of <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> outbreak conditions on businesses, workers, customers, and the public, it is important for all employers to plan now for <span class="covid">COVID-19</span>. Lack of continuity planning can result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address challenges of <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> with insufficient resources and workers who might not be adequately trained for jobs they may have to perform under pandemic conditions.

      <ul>
        <li>Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes <span class="covid">COVID-19</span>, can cause illness ranging from
          mild to severe and, in some cases, can be fatal. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, and
          shortness of breath.</li>
        <li>Some people infected with the virus have reported experiencing other non-respiratory
        symptoms.</li>
        <li>Other people, referred to as asymptomatic cases, have experienced no symptoms at all.</li>
        <li>According to the CDC, symptoms of <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14
        days after exposure</li>

      <h3>How <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> Spreads </h3>
      <p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
          <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets
          can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
          <li>It may be possible that a person can get <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> by touching a surface or object that has SARSCoV-2 on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.</li>
          <li>People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (i.e., experiencing fever,
          cough, and/or shortness of breath). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms;
          there have been reports of this type of asymptomatic transmission with this new coronavirus.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>How a <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> Outbreak Could Affect Workplace</h3>
      <p>Similar to influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes <span class="covid">COVID-19</span>, has the potential to cause
        extensive outbreaks. In the absence of a vaccine, an outbreak may also be an extended event. As a result,
        workplaces may experience:

          <td><span class="ctable">Absenteeism </span>- Workers could be absent because they are sick ,are caregivers for sick family members, are caregivers for children if schools or day care centers are closed, have at-risk people at home, such as immunocompromised family members or are afraid to come to work because of fear of possible exposure</td>
          <td><span class="ctable">Change in patterns of commerce </span>- Consumers may also change shopping patterns because of a <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> outbreak.Consumers may try to shop at off-peak hours to reduce contact with other people, show
          increased interest in home delivery services, or prefer other options, such as drivethrough service, to reduce person-to-person contact</td>
          <td><span class="ctable">Interrupted supply / delivery </span>- Shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> may be delayed or cancelled with or without notification.</td>

      <h3>Stay at Home Health Tips</h3>
      <div style="background-color: #F8F8FF">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" id="b11">TAKE CARE OF YOUR BASIC NEEDS: SIMPLE ACTIVITIES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE </div>
      <ul class="alert alert-primary" role="alert" id="flexi">
        <li>TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY. Ensure you stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and have sufficient sleep and rest during the day</li>
        <li>STAY CLEAN. Try to look after your personal hygiene as you would if you were travelling to the office each day.</li>
        <li>GET PHYSICAL. Make sure you do some physical activity every day. Be imaginative with exercise; there is a lot you can do even if you are indoors. Consider online resources that can be completed with minimal exercise equipment</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" id="b11">MINIMIZE FACTORS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH </div>
      <ul class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" id="flexi">
        <li>MINIMIZE UNHELPFUL COPING STRATEGIES. Smoking, alcohol or the use of other recreational drugs will have a negative impact on your mental and physical health in the long-run</li>
        <li>SEEK ACCURATE INFORMATION. A near constant stream of information can cause anxiety or distress, particularly when it includes misinformation or unsourced rumours. Manage your consumption of news and information; seek updates and guidance at limited and specific times of the day from health professionals, your national health authority, and the WHO website.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" id="b11">STAY CONNECTED</div>
      <ul class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" id="flexi">
        <li>IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS (WORK-RELATED AND SOCIAL).Don’t be afraid to express your needs to your friends, your colleagues or your managers. Stay connected and maintain your social networks. Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to protect your mental health and reduce loneliness and boredom during physical distancing measures.</li>
        <li>REMAIN VISIBLE. Set up regular times to connect with colleagues and managers so you can update others on your current tasks and progress, and check in on how others are coping when working from home. Stay in regular contact with any external partners you may be working with.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" id="b11">DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOUR WELLBEING</div>
      <ul class="alert alert-info" role="alert" id="flexi">
        <li>THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT WELLBEING STRATEGIES THAT WORK FOR YOU REMAIN EFFECTIVE. For example, make time in your daily schedule to engage with favourite art/culture/entertainment. With a new working schedule and lifestyle, think about learning a new skill, or attending an online class.Set aside time for relaxation or spiritual practices, if they are part of your life.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" id="b11">GET ORGANISED</div>
      <ul class="alert alert-dark" role="alert" id="flexi">
        <li>CREATE A DAILY ROUTINE. In this extended teleworking period, time management is particularly important. Ensure you are providing ample time for working as well as ample time for your personal life and family. In emergency or other high -pressure environments, there may be a tendency to overwork or to blur the boundaries between work and leisure. Creating structured activities and routines will help you feel more in control of your time and environment. Routines can also be very helpful for staff working from home, who may be also providing care to their children.</li>
        <li>MAINTAIN BOUNDARIES. Start and finish work on time by creating clear boundaries between work and personal life as much as possible. Set alarms to remind you to take breaks. Do not fall into the trap of overworking because there are few distractions; your mental health may suffer in the long run. </li>
        <li>HELP YOURSELF MAINTAIN FOCUS. If possible, designate an area of the home as your work area. When it is time to finish work, leave your materials there.</li>
        <li>BE COMFORTABLE IN YOUR NEW WORKSPACE. Be aware of your workspace, audio setup, and desk and chair comfort which can affect your posture and productivity. You may choose to wear work clothes or work shoes to help you feel prepared for work; and leisure wear to help you transition to personal time, just as you would when coming home from work</li>
