    	<h3 id="1">Welcome !!</h3>
       	<p> Hello, world! This is my first project on Python and Web programming. It has been a while since I last developed a serious web application and I have always had deep passion in programming and solving problems. My current domain of work is mostly on ERP systems, supporting and enhacing solutions, mainly, off-the-shelf ERPs. I want to diversify and focus on opensource ERPs and which are mostly web applications. To refresh my skills that will aid in achieving this goal and solve most of my day-to-day ERP demands, I endevored to complete this CS50 course. Working from home, amid covid-19, has provided me with the chance to focus and complete the course. </p>
       	<p> With the unfolding events around the world about Corona Visrus, our first priority, as humans, currently in this world is to stay alive. Everything else doesn't matter if our heath safety is at enormous risk. The economy is suffering at levels never imagined before. Governments are now issuing guidleines on how to prevent and slow the spread of the deadly virus. So without doubt, we are obliged to heed to these goverment directives, guidelines and preventive measures which amongst others include:
       	<ul>
       		<li>Stay at home as much as possible</li>
       		<li>Wash your hands frequently</li>
       		<li>Maintain social distance</li>
       		<li>Wear masks at all times in public places</li>
       		<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</li>
       		<li>Practice respiratory hygiene</li>
       	</ul>
       </p>
       	<div id="comment">With the stay-at-home advisory by the national goverment and encouragement of work-from home policy, my organization encouraged its employees to work at home as much as possible. Obviously some members of my family are enjoying seeing their dad working from home every day, my kids especially.</div>
        <p>In this project I will focus on Corona Virus, providing different information about what it is, its symptoms and so on.</p>
       	<h3 id="3">About Corona Virus</h3>
       	<div id="covid">
	       	<p class="screen-only">Coronavirus Disease 2019 <span class="covid">(COVID-19)</span> is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has
				spread from China to many other countries around the world, including Kenya. Depending on the
				severity of COVID-19’s international impacts, outbreak conditions—including those rising to the level of a pandemic—can affect all aspects of daily life, including travel, trade, tourism, food supplies, and financial markets.
				To reduce the impact of <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> outbreak conditions on businesses, workers, customers, and the
				public, it is important for all employers to plan now for <span class="covid">COVID-19</span>. Lack of continuity planning can result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address challenges of COVID-19 with insufficient resources and workers who might not be adequately trained for jobs they may have to perform under pandemic conditions.
