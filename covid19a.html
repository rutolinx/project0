		<li>Assume overall responsibility to ensure that all necessary preventive and protective measures are taken to minimize occupational safety and health risks;</li>
		<li>Provide information, instruction and training on occupational safety and health, including;
			o Refresher training on infection prevention and control (IPC); and
			o Use, putting on, taking off and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE);</li>
		<li>Provide adequate IPC and PPE supplies (masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, hand sanitizer, soap and water, cleaning supplies) in sufficient quantity to healthcare or other staff caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, such that workers do not incur expenses for occupational safety and health requirements;</li>
		<li>Familiarize personnel with technical updates on COVID-19 and provide appropriate tools to assess, triage, test and treat patients and to share infection prevention and control information with patients and the public;</li>
		<li>As needed, provide with appropriate security measures for personal safety;</li>
		<li>Provide a blame-free environment for workers to report on incidents, such as exposures to blood or bodily fluids from the respiratory system or to cases of violence, and to adopt measures for immediate follow up, including support to victims;</li>
		<li>Advise workers on self-assessment, symptom reporting and staying home when ill;</li>
		<li>Consult with health workers on occupational safety and health aspects of their work and notify the labour inspectorate of cases of occupational diseases;</li>
		<li>Not be required to return to a work situation where there is continuing or serious danger to life or health, until the employer has taken any necessary remedial action;</li>
		<li>Allow workers to exercise the right to remove themselves from a work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. When a health worker exercises this right, they shall be protected from any undue consequences;</li>
		<li>Honour the right to compensation, rehabilitation and curative services if infected with COVID-19 following exposure in the workplace. This would be considered occupational exposure and resulting illness would be considered an occupational disease,</li>
